Did you know you can valide your wenmention implementation using [webmention.rocks](https://webmention.rocks/)?

I don't have much to validate yet, but I'll give it a try anyway, to see how it goes. For now I'm using custom scripts, that are triggered manually
<a href="https://webmention.rocks/test/1">Test 1</a>
<a href="https://webmention.rocks/test/2">Test 2</a>
<a href="https://webmention.rocks/test/3">Test 3</a>
<a href="https://webmention.rocks/test/4">Test 4</a>
<a href="https://webmention.rocks/test/5">Test 5</a>
